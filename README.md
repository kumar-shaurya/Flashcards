## App Idea & Features Implemented

This is a simple, cross-platform flashcard application. It's designed to help you study and memorize information using digital flashcards. The app has a clean, user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and interact with your flashcard decks.

### Key Features:

## Tech Stack & Libraries Used

This application is built with a minimal and efficient tech stack to ensure broad compatibility and performance on various platforms.

* **Beeware**: The core framework used to build this cross-platform application. Beeware allows us to write the app in Python and deploy it on different platforms (like Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices) from a single codebase.

* **Toga**: Toga is Beeware's native, cross-platform UI toolkit. It's used to create all the graphical elements of the app, such as buttons, labels, and input fields.

* **JSON**: The built-in Python `json` library is used to save and load the flashcard data, ensuring that your cards are saved between sessions.
